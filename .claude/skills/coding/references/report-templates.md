## Usage Notes

### Variable Placeholders

| Placeholder             | Description                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `{task_description}`    | Original task from user                        |
| `{timestamp}`           | ISO 8601 or human-readable date                |
| `{session_folder_path}` | Full path like `.claude/.docs/260110-feature/` |
| `{agent_name}`          | scouter, researcher, or reviewer               |
| `{mode}`                | single or parallel                             |
| `{count}`               | Number of instances or issues                  |

### Report Generation Rules

1. **Research Report**: Created after Research phase completes (not skipped)
2. **Plan Report**: Created after Plan phase completes (not skipped)
3. **Review Report**: Created after Review phase completes (not skipped)

### CRITICAL: Write EXACT Content, NOT Summary

**All reports MUST contain EXACT content from their respective phases:**

- **Research Report**: Include full agent findings, not summarized versions
- **Plan Report**: Copy EXACT text from plan mode - every step, file, decision, risk
- **Review Report**: Include all findings exactly as reported by reviewer

**DO NOT:**
- Summarize or condense the content
- Paraphrase or reword findings
- Omit details for brevity
- Write generic placeholder text

**DO:**
- Copy exact content word-for-word from the phase output
- Preserve all formatting, bullet points, and structure
- Include every detail mentioned during the phase

### File Locations

Reports are saved in the session folder:

```
.claude/.docs/{session-id}/
├── state.json
├── research-report.md  (if research executed)
├── plan-report.md      (if plan executed)
└── review-report.md    (if review executed)
```

### Workflow Differences

| Report Section         | /code (Full) | /code:fast (Lite) |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Agent Full Response    | Included     | Summarized        |
| Architecture Decisions | Included     | Omitted           |
| Potential Risks        | Included     | Omitted           |
| Suggestions (Review)   | Included     | Omitted           |
